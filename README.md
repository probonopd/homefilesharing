A simple application that shows other computers running this application on
your LAN, and allows file transfers between trusted computers.

While there have been others like this before, they were either way too
complex, didn't support encryption, or didn't provide source code so I could
fix their bugs (aka. "commercial" software).


Features
--------

 - File listing and transfer
 - Automatic discovery of other machines
 - Authentication
 - Randomart (like in SSH, but prettier) for easier signature verification
 - Encryption
