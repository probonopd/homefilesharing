your LAN, and allows file transfers between trusted computers.

While there have been others like this before, none have had proper

Features
--------

 - File listing and transfer
 - Automatic discovery of other machines
 - Authentication
 - Randomart (like in SSH, but prettier) for easier signature verification
 - Encryption
